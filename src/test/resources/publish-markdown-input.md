It is important to know some basic commands to use properly the terminal and to be comfortable.

**You can access to the terminal using `Ctrl + Alt + T`**

# Shell utilities

The `Shell` acts as an interface between the user and the `Kernel`. Shell is an intermediate program that accepts the commands, typed at the terminal and executes them to obtain kernel understandable command set.

- Programming language constructs: shell provides powerful constructs using which exiting commands can be used to frame the job sequances or develop new utilities

- Shell script: Shell commands and constructs are stored in a file, which can later be used to execute these commands like a program. This file is generally called shell script.

- Shell vaiables: Like other programming language one can define variable in shell program also. These variables are identified by prefixing their names with `$` sign.
